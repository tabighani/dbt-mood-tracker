# dbt-mood-tracker
Hello!
Welcome to my repository. My prototype is a GUI application; a mood tracker that adheres to a subset of Dialectic Behavioural Therapy principles.
The program I used was Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and the language I used was Python. I utilised Tkinter as my main feature library.
